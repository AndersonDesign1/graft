## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- f423a6e: Every package ships a README, a description, keywords and a LICENSE.

  `0.1.1` published sixteen packages with no README and, for fourteen of them, no
  `description` either. On npm that renders as a blank page and an unsearchable
  listing: `description` is the line npm search shows, and without keywords the
  packages are findable only by exact name.

  Each README says what the package is, how to install it, and shows one real
  example using its actual exports. The security-relevant ones state their
  defaults plainly, because "MdxBody refuses executable MDX by default" is
  something a reader should not have to find in an ADR.

  `LICENSE` is now copied into each package. `files: ["dist"]` does not exclude
  `README.md` or `LICENSE` (npm always packs those), but a licence file only ships
  if it exists in the package directory, and the root one does not count.
