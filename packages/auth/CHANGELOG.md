### Minor Changes

- f423a6e: Every package ships a README, a description, keywords and a LICENSE.

  `0.1.1` published sixteen packages with no README and, for fourteen of them, no
  `description` either. On npm that renders as a blank page and an unsearchable
  listing: `description` is the line npm search shows, and without keywords the
  packages are findable only by exact name.

  Each README says what the package is, how to install it, and shows one real
  example using its actual exports. The security-relevant ones state their
  defaults plainly, because "MdxBody refuses executable MDX by default" is
  something a reader should not have to find in an ADR.

  `LICENSE` is now copied into each package. `files: ["dist"]` does not exclude
  `README.md` or `LICENSE` (npm always packs those), but a licence file only ships
  if it exists in the package directory, and the root one does not count.

- d6cbc3d: Thirteen self-contained defects, led by a data-loss bug in the editor.

  - **The editor wrote one document's content into another document's file.**
    `persist` took `collection`/`slug` from the current route closure while taking
    the bytes from a ref. On an A → B navigation React re-renders with route=B
    before the pending flush runs, so A's edits were written to B's path,
    destroying it — and the toast said "Saved B/B". Identity now comes from the
    same snapshot as the content, via a new `buildSavePayload` that takes it as an
    argument, which makes the mismatch unrepresentable. Document loads are
    sequenced so out-of-order responses cannot show one document under another's
    route.
  - `updateRecord` read, merged and wrote with no lock, so two concurrent callers
    both merged over the same baseline and the second silently erased the first.
    Now one transaction with `SELECT … FOR UPDATE`, and the "unreachable"
    `throw new Error` is a real `DOCUMENT_NOT_FOUND`.
  - A malformed URL escape white-screened the Studio (`parseHash` runs in a
    `useState` initialiser, so the `URIError` threw during first render) and
    turned Studio asset and route-id requests into misleading 500s.
  - The compiled static index briefly did not exist: `rmSync` then `renameSync`
    left a window where readers got `STATIC_INDEX_NOT_FOUND`, and a crash between
    them destroyed the artifact. Now an atomic rename, falling back only on
    Windows.
  - Data migrations persisted the raw transform output instead of the validated
    result, so Zod defaults and coercions never reached the stored rows, and
    compared with key-order-sensitive `JSON.stringify` against jsonb that
    normalises key order — rewriting identical rows.
  - The generated `graft/index.ts` barrel emitted duplicate imports when two
    filenames collapsed onto one identifier (`my-mod.ts` and `myMod.ts`), in a
    file marked "do not edit". It now refuses and names both offenders.
  - `graft dev` kept watching the original content directory after a config reload
    moved it, so every later save was invisible.
  - OIDC tokens without a `sub` claim authenticated as an actor with no id.
    `requiredClaims: ["sub"]` now rejects them.
  - `applyPlan` trusted a conflict snapshot taken when the plan was built; it now
    re-checks disk immediately before each write.
  - A `??` chain in the pages-description migration short-circuited on an empty
    string, so the documented title fallback was never reached.
  - All four GitHub Actions are pinned to commit SHAs, and the release workflow's
    `id-token: write` is scoped to the publish job rather than the whole file.
